Numinder
=============

Hello, and welcome to Numinder.

I wrote Numinder to better fit one of my uses of Quicksilver: setting and
displaying timed notifications. Though Quicksilver offers very good tools 
to time and display custom notifications, its notification text is very large
and its usage somewhat hackish.

I wrote Numinder to serve as a similar tool that parses either a time to delay 
or a time to display a notification, then displays that notification with Growl.

Installation:
------

Numinder requires [Nu][nu] and [Growl][grl].framework.
To build Numinder, type `nuke` in the Numinder directory.
Numinder requires that Growl.framework be located in the
`/Library/Frameworks/` directory.

[nu]: http://programming.nu
[grl]: http://growl.info/
